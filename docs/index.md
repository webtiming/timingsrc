Timing has come to the Web.

> **Timingsrc** provides a new programming model for precisely timed Web applications, based on the [timing object](http://webtiming.github.io/timingobject/).

For **multi-device** timing support, simply plug a *timing provider* into your *timing object*. [Shared Motion](shared_motion.html) by [Motion Corporation](http://motioncorporation.com) provides millisecond precise timing **globally** for Web clients, and is open for non-commercial use.

- Want to provide echoless sync of HTML5 video, globally, in 3 lines of code? 
	- Check out the [MediaSync demo](doc/online_mediasync.html).
- Want to playback timed data simultaneously on devices across the world? 
	- Check out the [Sequencer demo](doc/online_sequencer.html).
- Want to make your own multi-device timing demo? 
	- Check out the [Shared Motion](doc/shared_motion.html) timing provider.




## Standardization

The [W3C Multi-device Timing Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webtiming/), advocated for the standardization of the timing object. The group was closed early 2025 but hopes that renewed discussions on a timing model for the Web will take place and encourages interested parties to reach out to the [Media and Entertainment Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/me) for coordination, through its [public-web-and-tv@w3.org](mailto:public-web-and-tv@w3.org) mailing-list.

Agreement on a common API for timing resources would enable:

#### 1) temporal interoperability
very different timing sensitive components could easily be integrated into a single consistent presentation. This would allow the classical fruits of composition, i.e. mash-up, integration, code-reuse, flexibility and extensibility to be fully exploited by timing sensitive Web applications.

#### 2) multi-device timing
timing objects integrate with online timing providers allowing multi-device application to exploit temporal composition in the global scope.

#### 3) common programming concepts, tools and practices
timing challenges can be addressed using the same concepts and tools, across separate application domains (e.g. music, broadcast, Web-media). New concepts and tools building on a standard will apply to a much broader community.

#### 4) separation of concerns
online timing providers may focus on the challenges of distributed timing, while application developers may focus on exploiting timing for the purpose of creating great user experiences.     




## Relation to timing object specification

The timingsrc library serves as a reference implementation for the [Timing Object Draft Spec](http://webtiming.github.io/timingobject/). It was maintained by the [W3C Multi-device Timing Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webtiming/) until early 2025. It is now maintained by individual authors.
