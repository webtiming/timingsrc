\abstract*{Each chapter should be preceded by an abstract (10--15 lines long) that summarizes the content. The abstract will appear \textit{online} at \url{www.SpringerLink.com} and be available with unrestricted access. This allows unregistered users to read the abstract as a teaser for the complete chapter. As a general rule the abstracts will not appear in the printed version of your book unless it is the style of your particular book or that of the series to which your book belongs.
Please use the 'starred' version of the new Springer \texttt{abstract} command for typesetting the text of the online abstracts (cf. source file of this chapter template \texttt{abstract}) and include them with the source files of your manuscript. Use the plain \texttt{abstract} command if the abstract is also to appear in the printed version of the book.}

\section{Section Heading}
\label{sec:1}
Use the template \emph{chapter.tex} together with the Springer document class SVMono (monograph-type books) or SVMult (edited books) to style the various elements of your chapter content in the Springer layout.

Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to
let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.
Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your
cross-references and citations. And please note that the first line of
text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of
all subsequent paragraphs are.

\section{Section Heading}
\label{sec:2}
% Always give a unique label
% and use \ref{<label>} for cross-references
% and \cite{<label>} for bibliographic references
% use \sectionmark{}
% to alter or adjust the section heading in the running head
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to
let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.
Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your
cross-references and citations.

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

Use the standard \verb|equation| environment to typeset your equations, e.g.
%
\begin{equation}
a \times b = c\;,
\end{equation}
%
however, for multiline equations we recommend to use the \verb|eqnarray| environment\footnote{In physics texts please activate the class option \texttt{vecphys} to depict your vectors in \textbf{\itshape boldface-italic} type - as is customary for a wide range of physical subjects}.
\begin{eqnarray}
a \times b = c \nonumber\\
\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}=\vec{c}
\label{eq:01}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Subsection Heading}
\label{subsec:2}

let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.
Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your
cross-references\index{cross-references} and citations\index{citations}
as has already been described in Sect.~\ref{sec:2}.

\begin{quotation}
Please do not use quotation marks when quoting texts! Simply use the \verb|quotation| environment -- it will automatically render Springer's preferred layout.

\subsubsection{Subsubsection Heading}
Instead of simply listing headings of different levels we recommend to
let every heading be followed by at least a short passage of text.
Further on please use the \LaTeX\ automatism for all your
cross-references and citations as has already been described in
Sect.~\ref{subsec:2}, see also Fig.~\ref{fig:1}\footnote{If you copy
text passages, figures, or tables from other works, you must obtain
\textit{permission} from the copyright holder (usually the original
publisher). Please enclose the signed permission with the manuscript. The
sources\index{permission to print} must be acknowledged either in the
captions, as footnotes or in a separate section of the book.}

Please note that the first line of text that follows a heading is not indented, whereas the first lines of all subsequent paragraphs are.

% For figures use
%
\begin{figure}[b]
\sidecaption
% Use the relevant command for your figure-insertion program
% to insert the figure file.
% For example, with the graphicx style use
\includegraphics[scale=.65]{figure}
%
% If no graphics program available, insert a blank space i.e. use
%\picplace{5cm}{2cm} % Give the correct figure height and width in cm
%
\caption{If the width of the figure is less than 7.8 cm use the \texttt{sidecapion} command to flush the caption on the left side of the page. If the figure is positioned at the top of the page, align the sidecaption with the top of the figure -- to achieve this you simply need to use the optional argument \texttt{[t]} with the \texttt{sidecaption} command}

When placed at the end of a chapter or contribution (as opposed to at the end of the book), the numbering of tables, figures, and equations in the appendix section continues on from that in the main text. Hence please \textit{do not} use the \verb|appendix| command when writing an appendix at the end of your chapter or contribution. If there is only one the appendix is designated ``Appendix'', or ``Appendix 1'', or ``Appendix 2'', etc. if there is more than one.
